        p
          | Creative’s then-current ecommerce website had been around for
          | more than a decade and its age was showing. Besides a dated look
          | and feel, there were also usability issues that were hindering
          | navigation. In terms of site architecture, the online store was
          | split from the product information pages. In addition, each
          | product line had its own micro-site, each with a unique design.
          | Although online sales were still strong in the European and
          | North American markets, Creative risked losing business as
          | conversion rates decreased. An overhaul was needed.

        p
          | We sat down together with the stakeholders to understand their goals
          | for the revamp and work out a strategy together for the website. We
          | found out that besides being an online storefront, the website also
          | had to fulfill marketing and branding functions. These conversations
          | with the stakeholders helped us map out what we wanted to achieve
          | and what needed to be done.

        h3 User Experience Audit
        p
          | The first thing we helped out with was the information architecture.
          | We reorganized the website and made recommendations about product
          | categories. This was followed by a discussion with the team
          | regarding the data from the analytics they had already installed on
          | their site. From there, we identified the pain points, and conducted
          | a heuristic evaluation of the key drop-off points. This gave us a
          | really good idea about which parts of the website needed improvement
          | and which could be kept.

        h3 Interaction Design
        p
          | A key component was the shopping cart and checkout process. We
          | completely streamlined the checkout process to make it as easy as
          | possible for Creative’s customers to complete their purchase.

        h3 Visual Interface Design
        p
          | We completely reimagined Creative’s online presence. The art
          | direction we provided informed the look and feel of all Creative
          | sites worldwide

                | We took the time to build a collaborative relationship with
                | the client, working as a team to find answers to the problems
                | we were solving. This approach helped to foster trust and
                | momentum when it came to execution.
