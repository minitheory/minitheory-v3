        h3 Going from Beta to Launch
        p
          | travelmob had a beta site up and running, but they were seeking
          | a better user experience and interface in the lead up to their
          | official launch. The challenge: balancing the short timeframe
          | and the amount of work that needs to be done to their existing
          | site, while improving overall usability.

        h3 Tackling the Key User Flows
        p
          | In order to prioritize the work that needs to be done, we evaluated
          | the key user flows of the beta site, that of a Guest looking for
          | accommodation, and a Host looking to list his apartment.

        h3 Encouraing Discovery
        p
          | As a Guest, we wanted to know what was key in determining if you
          | would stay at a local’s home? From travelmob’s user feedback, users
          | were apprehensive about making bookings through the website. To
          | alleviate this, we improved the showcase of accommodations on the
          | homepage; and made the call to action a lot more prominent,
          | encouraging users to discover the potential accommodation types
          | available on the website.

          | The introduction of the banner section also allowed curated

          | alike.

          | The introduction of a cleaner interface to the search experience,
          | with improved typography and colors, allowed users to focus on the
          | listing results. The experience tags feature from travelmob has also
          | been designed in a less intrusive manner where users can quickly
          | discover the kind of experiences an accommodation offers.

        h3 An Easier Listing Experience
        p
          | For Hosts, the need was in streamlining the experience of listing
          | their accommodations on the website. The beta site had a single page
          | form and users were dropping off and not completing the process. To
          | balance the numerous fields they were required to input, we went
          | with a step approach, breaking the form into 3 key steps, and
          | conveying to users where they were at in the sign up process. This
          | made the task less daunting, and users were able to gauge with the
          | help of the step indicator, how far they were into completing the
          | process.

                h3 Prioritising Design Needs
                p
                  | When approaching a project, there is always a tendency to execute
                  | on every feature and design change seeking a perfect product
                  | strategy. In reality, that approach is often not possible due to
                  | resource constraints. As such, prioritizing the design needs based
                  | on key user behaviors and flows will help address the larger and
                  | more important usability issues first which are key to the
                  | business.

                h3 Close Collaboration
                p
                  | The key to being able to launch in a short timeline was working
                  | closely with the Product and Engineering team at travelmob. As a
                  | design team, we were able to leverage their domain knowledge and
                  | experience in coming up with the solutions.
