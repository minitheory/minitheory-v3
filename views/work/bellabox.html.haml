    Bellabox is a monthly Australian subscription service which sends you a surprise beauty box of upcoming and cult products. They came to Minitheory to overhaul their website, which didn’t meet their growing needs.

  %p.lead 
    Minitheory worked with the Bellabox team and a development partner to craft a seamless experience across their subscription, e-commerce and editorial websites. With the new website, subscribers can easily buy, leave feedback and read more about their products.

      %h3 Addressing the biggest painpoints
      %p
        From previous user research and customer support feedback, the most common question was “Where’s my box?”. The biggest painpoint for subscribers was not knowing when their box would arrive that month. 

      %p
        Now when subscribers log in, they see a dashboard of their box’s status - preparing, shipped and an estimated delivery date. Also, when users buy a subscription, they can immediately see when their first box will arrive.

      %h3 Getting Creative
      %p
        We sat down together with the stakeholders to understand their goals
        for the revamp and work out a strategy together for the website. We
        found out that besides being an online storefront, the website also
        had to fulfill marketing and branding functions. These conversations
        with the stakeholders helped us map out what we wanted to achieve
        and what needed to be done.

      %h3 Making the beauty profile fun to fill in
      %p
        Bellabox picks the samples for each subscriber’s box based on their beauty profile, which allows subscribers to get products to their own preferences. However, with the form-entry style of the old beauty profile, more than 2000 subscribers never filled it in.

      %p
        Filling in a beauty profile should be fun! We designed a more visual and interactive format for filling in answers, and worked with the team to craft clearer questions.

      %h3 A visual style guide for consistency and to save time
      %p
        When we mapped out the site structure, we knew that we had to design a visual system to maintain consistency throughout the website.

      %p
        The final style guide for Bellabox had about 30 distinct page structures and several types of widgets. This will allow the bellabox team to save time as they can quickly create new pages from the templates.

      %h3 Integrating agile development and design
      %p
        For 6 months, we worked closely with the bellabox team and a development partner - it was our first time integrating design methods like user research, ideation and prototyping into an agile workflow. It was a lot of learning and growing for us, and we’re proud to launch the bellabox V2 website in Sep 2014!
