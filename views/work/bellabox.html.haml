    bellabox is an Australian beauty subscription service and online store. Each
    month, bellabox's subscribers receive a box of beauty samples, specially
    tailored to match their beauty profile.

  %p.lead
    Together with a development partner, Minitheory worked with the bellabox
    team to revamp their website, crafting a seamless experience across their
    subscription, e-commerce and editorial websites.
  %p.lead
    As a result, bellabox's subscribers could now easily buy, leave
    feedback and learn more about their products.

      %h3 Getting creative, together
      %p
        We sat down together with the stakeholders to understand their goals
        for the revamp and work out a strategy together for the website. We
        found out that besides being an online storefront, the website also
        had to fulfill marketing and branding functions. These conversations
        with the stakeholders helped us map out what we wanted to achieve
        and what needed to be done.

      %h3 Addressing the biggest pain point: &ldquo;Where's my box?&rdquo;
      %p
        Based on user research and feedback from bellabox's customer
        support team, the most common question subscribers asked was &ldquo;where&rsquo;s
        my box?&rdquo;. It was obvious that the biggest painpoint for
        subscribers was not knowing when their box would arrive that month.

      %p
        To address this pain point, we created a dashboard where subscribers
        could view their box&rsquo;s status &ndash; preparing, shipped and an
        estimated delivery date. We also enhanced the new subscriber experience,
        ensuring that they get immediate feedback on when their first box will
        arrive.

      %h3 Making the beauty profile fun to fill in
      %p
        Each month, bellabox picks beauty samples for each subscriber&rsquo;s
        box based on their preferences indicated in their own beauty profiles.
        This allows subscribers to get products specifically tailored to their
        own preferences.
      %p
        Despite this, more than 2,000 subscribers never filled in their beauty
        profiles! We identified the plain-looking entry form to be the culprit
        and set out to make filling in the beauty profile a more fun and engaging
        experience for subscribers.
      %p
        We designed a more visual and interactive format for filling in answers
        and worked with the team to craft clearer questions:

      %h3 Ensuring visual consistency and saving time with style guides
      %p
        The bellabox website had about 30 distinct page structures and
        several types of widgets. When we mapped it all out, we knew that we had
        to design a visual system to maintain consistency throughout the website.
      %p
        The style guide we prepared for the bellabox team covered common
        page structures, widgets and components, helping to ensure consistency
        as new interface elements are added.
      %p
        Additionally, time savings were achieved as the bellabox team
        could quickly create new pages from the templates we provided.

      %h3 Integrating agile development and design
      %p
        For six months, we worked closely with the bellabox team and a
        development partner &ndash; it was our first time integrating design
        methods such as user research, ideation and prototyping into an agile
        workflow.
      %p
        It was a lot of learning and growing for us, and we were proud to launch
        the bellabox website in September 2014!
