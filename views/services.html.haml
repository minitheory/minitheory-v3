            %h4 Listening is our most important skill
            %p To make software that feels natural, we try to get a deep understanding of who we’re designing for. We talk to the people using the software in their daily tasks to model their workflow. Sometimes this also means the different stakeholders in your company as well. We listen carefully to get an idea of their pain points and the problems we have to solve.

This allows us to explore many different ideas really quickly. We use these to spark a conversation with you so we can create a great solution together.

            %h4 Prototyping
            %p Creativity needs to be focussed in order to be effective. A quick prototype helps us check whether we are designing the right thing for users. It’s an efficient way to validate ideas and reduce waste during development. Prototyping also helps us refine the design to make it easy to use.
            %br
            %h4 Visual design
            %p We are fanatical about perfectly placed pixels. However, attention to detail needs to be balanced with the big picture goal of making something useful. We’ll work with you to nail down the art direction and create a design system, rather than lay out every page in Photoshop. This helps designs and developers go faster.
            %br
            %h4 Guiding implementation
            %p We’ve worked with developers from all over the world, remotely and in person. We’ll help you guide the development so that the product vision becomes reality.
