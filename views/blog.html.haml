                How can UX designers produce high quality work in a fast-paced
                sprint-based agile team? Does the systematic UX design process
                make it inherently contradictory with agile principles? After working
                closely with one of our clientâ€™s agile teams for almost a year, we
                learned the many complexities a UX designer would encounter when integrating
                user centred design into an engineering-driven team. Understanding these
                complexities allows us to adopt an efficient new design process that helps
                produce better designed products faster.
